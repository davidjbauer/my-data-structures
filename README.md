My implementations of some basic data structures in C++, with some tests written using Google Test.
I'm statically linking Google Test, so I've included the googletest directory here.

Implemented so far: Singly-linked list.
To-do: Hash table, stack, queue, heap, tree, BST, graph, trie, doubly-linked list.
